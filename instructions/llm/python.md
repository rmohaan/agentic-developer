# Python Instructions

- Follow existing style and typing discipline in the repository.
- Use pytest conventions and fixtures already present.
- For class-level static behavior, call `ClassName.method(...)` rather than instance-only patterns.
- Keep tests deterministic and avoid hidden global state coupling.
- Include assertions for exceptions and boundary inputs when logic changes.
