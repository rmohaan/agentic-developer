# Next.js Instructions

- Respect App Router vs Pages Router structure used in repository.
- For route handlers and server actions, add tests at handler/function boundary where possible.
- Do not introduce client-only APIs into server components.
- Keep browser-specific APIs in client components only.
- Add tests for changed rendering/data paths using existing repo test tooling.
